This module contains some basic implementations of the perceptron and averaged
perceptron (an approximation to the voted perceptron).

The perceptron is one of the simplest discriminative classifiers out there: for
a given training example x, if the perceptron classification y' is the same as
the correct label y, do nothing; otherwise, adjust the weight vector for class y
as w += x and the weight vector for class y' as w -= x.

The source distribution includes a basic test module that loads the "oil" data
distributed with the Bishop material online and classifies it using several
perceptron variants. Run this test with :

python perceptron_test.py

Have fun !
